This file is trying to guide you to add new device support for new beckhoff
bus terminal(NBBT).

1. Check Bx9000_MBTApp/src/Bx9000_MBT_Common.h, make sure the NBBT is defined
   in "enum BUSTERM_TYPE". If it's not, add the definition;

2. Add the image description to Bx9000_MBTApp/src/Bx9000_BTDef.h;

3. Add the function description to Bx9000_MBTApp/src/Bx9000_SigDef.h;

4. Write the new device support C file such as devKLxxxx.c, you can use
   exsiting one as the template;

5. Edit Bx9000_MBTApp/src/Makefile to add new line such as
	Bx9000_MBT_SRCS += devKLxxxx.c

6. Edit Bx9000_MBTApp/src/Bx9000_MBT.dbd to add new line such as
	device(ai,INST_IO,devAiKLxxxx,"Bx9000_KLxxxx")

7. Add new db template such as KLxxxx.template to Bx9000_MBTApp/Db;

8. Edit Bx9000_MBTApp/Db/Makefile to add line such as
	DB += KLxxxx.template

9. If you want to edit shared screen such as adding more slots to
   Bx9000_MBTApp/srcOpi/Bx9000InstalledBTs.edl, do it;

10. Download pdf manual file from www.beckhoff.com, and save to
    documentation/KLxxxxe.pdf;

11. Edit README file to tell user how to use your new beckhoff bus terminal
    support;

12. Edit Release and configure/RELEASE if you are changing release tag;

Now you are successfully add you new support.

If you want to add your new support to test application in BK9KVxTestApp,
you might have to do couple more things:

1. Edit BK9KVxTestApp/srcOpi/Beckhoff-test.edl to cover new bus terminals;

2. Edit iocBoot/iocBK9KVxTest/Bx9000Info-test.instance and
   iocBoot/iocBK9KVxTest/KLxxxx-test.instance because you slot assignment
   may be changed;

3. Add iocBoot/iocBK9KVxTest/KLxxxx-test.instance for new bus terminals;

4. Edit iocBoot/iocBK9KVxTest/st.cmd to change slot assignment and load new
   bus terminals;
5. Do same thing to BK9KSoftTest
